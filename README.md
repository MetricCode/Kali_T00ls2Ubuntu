KaliT00ls2Ubuntu is a python script which is made for new ubuntu users, to help them install all the default and basic kali linux tools as ubuntu does not come defaultly installed with them.


### Installation...
```
1. git clone https://github.com/MetricCode/Kali_T00ls2Ubuntu.git
2. cd Kali_T00ls2Ubuntu
3. chmod +x KaliT00ls2Ubuntu.py
4. sudo mv KaliT00ls2Ubuntu.py /usr/bin/KaliT00ls2Ubuntu
```
### Execution...
For the script to work, you need to run it as root and also you need to have installed python3 on your system.
```
sudo KaliT00ls2Ubuntu
```
##### If there is this error;
```
/usr/bin/env: ‘python2\r’: No such file or directory
/usr/bin/env: use -[v]S to pass options in shebang lines
```
we can fix it by runing this command:
```
sudo dos2unix /usr/bin/KaliT00ls2Ubuntu
```
- Basically, the script first of checks if your system is updated.
